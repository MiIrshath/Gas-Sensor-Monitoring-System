# Gas-Sensor-Monitoring-System

* The proposed system makes use of ATmega 328 mircrocontroller. Arduino UNO board is employed as a base for the entire system. The system consists of an MQ-6 gas sensor attached thereto along side a thermostat. 
* These two devices sense the gas levels and therefore the temperature of the environment where the system is installed and show the output i.e. the readings on an LCD display.
